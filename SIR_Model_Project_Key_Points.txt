Project Key Points:
- Simulation of an infectious disease spread in Bucharest.
- Utilizes the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model.
- Provides insights into the epidemiological dynamics of disease spread.

Required Libraries:
- numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.
- scipy: Specifically scipy.integrate for solving differential equations.
- matplotlib: For visualizing the data and simulation results.

Important Notes:
- The model parameters (initial conditions, transmission rate, recovery rate) can be adjusted to simulate different scenarios.
- The simulation assumes a closed population without births, deaths (other than from the disease), or migration.
- The results are theoretical and should be interpreted in the context of the model's simplifications and assumptions.
