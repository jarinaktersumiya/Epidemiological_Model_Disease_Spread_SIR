# Epidemiological_Model_Disease_Spread_SIR
A simulation of infectious disease spread in Bucharest using the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model. This project utilizes Python to model and visualize how a disease similar to COVID-19 might propagate through the population, providing insights into epidemiological dynamics.

# SIR Model Simulation for Bucharest

## Project Overview
This project involves simulating the spread of an infectious disease in Bucharest using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and aims to provide insights into how an infectious disease, similar to COVID-19, might spread and affect the population over time.

## Features
- Implementation of the SIR model in Python.
- Use of `numpy` and `scipy.integrate` for numerical operations and solving differential equations.
- Visualization of the disease spread dynamics using `matplotlib`.
- Detailed explanation and documentation within a Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project was developed using Python 3.x.
2. Install the required libraries. You can do this by running:

3. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `.ipynb` file.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`SIR_Model_Simulation_Bucharest.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment. This can be done using Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or even within Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter extension.
5. Run each cell in the notebook to see the code execution and the resulting plots.
